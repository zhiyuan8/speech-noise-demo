Original codes and data are at https://github.com/zhiyuan8/audio_features_analysis   
Open the link https://zhiyuan8.github.io/ and press **start**, then your audio features are drawn, and decisions are made every 1s. Press **Export Data** then mid-term features will be shown in a txt file.
The classification is based on kNN model, but more sophisticated models are being tunned now.
